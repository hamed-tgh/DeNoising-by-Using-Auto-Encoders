# DeNoising-by-Using-Auto-Encoders
Denoising MNIST dataset by using Auto-Encoders


# What is MNIST?
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

# Details
in this project first we add a gaussian noise to Train images of MNIST dataset, then by using Auto-Encoders we built a Denoiser.
